#F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

#To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, and add curly brackets {} as placeholders for variables and other operations.

age = 36
txt = f"My name is John, I am {age}"
print(txt)

#A placeholder can include a modifier to format the value.

#A modifier is included by adding a colon : followed by a legal formatting type, like .2f which means fixed point number with 2 decimals:
	
price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

#Perform a math operation in the placeholder, and return the result

txt = f"The price is {20 * 59} dollars"
print(txt)
